## Laser locking and linewidth measurements

### Questions

- which exact spectroscopy setup?
    - modulation transfes but no idea onto which exact line
- which modulation frequencies and depths?
    - 8 MHz 1V with resonant circuit
    - 6Â° phase shift on signal gen for demodulation
- linewidth estimation from stabilizer data? aka wide is the feature and how much do we still cover in the stabilized state?


### Linewidth measurement

- delayed self heterodyning
- 2km delay
-  



## Laser temperature stabilization

### Questions

- which laser?
- timeconstants?
- how do we compare the results? 
- cross measurements with stabilizer locking? aka does stabilizer need to do less when the temperature is more stable?
- Components?
